Plant Disease Detection Using VGG16 and Transfer Learning

Project Title: Plant-Disease-Detection using VGG16 (CNN Transfer Learning)
Dataset: TensorFlow Beans Dataset

Project Overview

This project applies Transfer Learning using the VGG16 convolutional neural network—pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset—to build a plant disease detection model. The model is trained and evaluated on the TensorFlow Beans dataset, which contains labeled images of healthy and diseased bean plant leaves.

Technologies and Tools

Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

Model Architecture: VGG16 (pretrained weights on ImageNet)

Dataset Source: TensorFlow Datasets (beans)

User Interface: Gradio Web-based Application

How to Run the Project in Google Colab

Open the provided Colab Notebook.

Run all the code cells sequentially.

At the end of the notebook, launch the Gradio interface to test predictions interactively.

Model Performance

Achieved ~95% validation accuracy after 10 training epochs, demonstrating strong capability in distinguishing healthy leaves from diseased ones.
